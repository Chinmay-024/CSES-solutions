## Introduction

The CSES Problem Set is a comprehensive collection of programming problems designed to help develop and improve problem-solving skills. These problems cover a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, mathematics, and more.

This repository aims to provide efficient and optimized solutions to the CSES problems, primarily using C++. The solutions are organized by problem category and include detailed explanations and comments to enhance understanding.

## Usage

To run the solutions, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Each solution is contained in a separate file named `problem_name.cpp`.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Chinmay-024/CSES-solutions.git`
2. Navigate to the problem directory: `cd cses-solutions/topic_name`
3. Compile the solution: `g++ problem_name.cpp -o problem_name`
4. Run the compiled program: `./problem_name`

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an optimized solution or an alternative approach to any of the problems, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best coding practices.
